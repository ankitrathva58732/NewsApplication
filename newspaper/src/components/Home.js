        News broadcasting is the medium of broadcasting various news events and
        other information via television, radio, or the internet in the field of
        broadcast journalism. The content is usually either produced locally in
        a radio studio or television studio newsroom, or by a broadcast network.
        It may include material such as sports coverage, weather forecasts,
        traffic reports, political commentary, expert opinions, editorial
        content, and other material that the broadcaster feels is relevant to
        their audience. An individual news program is typically reported in a
        series of individual stories that are presented by one or more anchors.
        A frequent inclusion is live or recorded interviews by field reporters.
